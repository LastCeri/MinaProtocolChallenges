# Mina Protocol Challenges

I wanted to display monthly assigned challenges with a UI. For ease of tracking, you can get detailed information about the challenge for the month that needs to be checked from the website.

Within the repository:
https://github.com/LastCeri/MinaProtocolChallenges/tree/main/minaprotocolchallenges/src/Challenges/
You can find completed challenges and their test codes.
